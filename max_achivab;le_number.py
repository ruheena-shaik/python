# Given two integers, num and t. A number x is achievable if it can become equal to num after applying the following operation at most t times:

# Increase or decrease x by 1, and simultaneously increase or decrease num by 1.
# Return the maximum possible value of x.


numbers = int(input("Enter num: "))
t = int(input("Enter t: "))

x = numbers + 2* t

print(x)
